- You should name files : index.html, hours.html, and contact.html

- There is minimal use of CSS already available in css/style.css . You need to link that file to your html files.

- All images are provided in the img folder.

- If you need to find the pizza emojis , try [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/pizza/).
